# VideoMerger-Web-Application
This project is a web-based video merging application that allows users to upload multiple MP4 videos and merge them into a single file. The app uses the @ffmpeg/ffmpeg library to handle video processing directly in the browser, providing a convenient and fast solution without the need for server-side video editing.
